NAME: Henry Unruh
CLASS: CS330
ASSIGNMENT: Programming Assignment 3, Estimating Pi.
SYNOPSIS: The goal of the assignment is to create a program that will numerically estimate the value of pi through four different methods of approximation - these methods are the trapezoid rule, Simpson's one-third rule, Simpson's three-eighths rule, and Boole's rule. These methods will print out error values that are relatively close to the value.

HOW-TO: to compile pi.c, use the makefile by typing 'make' (without the quote marks). This will effectively perform 'gcc -o pi pi.c' which will compile the program and create an executable called 'pi.' Run the program using './pi' (again, without the quote marks).
